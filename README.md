## ROS Best Practices, Conventions and Tricks

This is a dummy package to collect standar convetions and best practices for a C++ program in ROS. This package is oriented for guiding professors, students, researchers and laboratory technicians of Malaga University.

The [template_cpp_ros_pkg](https://github.com/Robotics-Mechatronics-UMA/Good_Practices_UMA/tree/master/template_cpp_ros_pkg) also includes a .yml for continous integration in ROS (working) in order to test the node execution.

Guides to how to program and integrate the package in the [wiki](https://github.com/Robotics-Mechatronics-UMA/Good_Practices_UMA/wiki).
