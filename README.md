## ROS Best Practices, Conventions and Tricks

This is a dummy package to collect standar convetions and best practices for a C++ program in ROS. This package is oriented for guiding professors, students, researchers and laboratory technicians of Malaga University.

The [template_cpp_ros_pkg](template_cpp_ros_pkg/) also includes a .yml for continous integration in ROS (working) in order to test the node execution. 

There are two ways to set the ci with dockers (EOL distributions) and without. Choose the correct file depending the linux and ros distribution by including in the  [workflows folder](/template_cpp_ros_pkg/.github/workflows/).
## Documents
